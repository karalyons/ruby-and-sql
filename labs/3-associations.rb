# This is a Rails app and we want to load all the files in the app 
# when running this code.  To do so, your current working directory
# should be the top-level directory (i.e. /workspace/your-app/) and then run:
# rails runner labs/3-associations.rb

# **************************
# DON'T CHANGE OR MOVE

# Lab 3: Associations
# - We've added data into the contacts table.  Next, we'll add data
#   into the activities table.  Follow the steps below to insert
#   activity data in the database.  Afterwards, display a
#   single salesperson's activity data:

# 1. insert 3 rows in the activities table with relationships to
# a single salesperson and 2 different contacts


puts "activities: #{Activity.all.count}"

ben = Salesperson.find_by({"first_name" => "Ben", "last_name" => "Block"})
#puts ben.inspect
tim = Contact.find_by({"email" =>})
jeff = Contact.find_by({"email => "})

activity = Activity.new
activity["salesperson_id"] = ben["id"]
#activity["contact_id"] = contact["id"]
activity["note"] = "He's funny"
activity.save

activity = Activity.new
activity["salesperson_id"] = ben["id"]
#activity["contact_id"] = contact["id"]
activity["note"] = "cute"
activity.save

activity = Activity.new
activity["salesperson_id"] = ben["id"]
#activity["contact_id"] = contact["id"]
activity["note"] = "Dumb"
activity.save

puts "activities: #{Activity.all.count}"

# 2. Display all the activities between the salesperson used above
# and one of the contacts (sample output below):

# ---------------------------------
# Activities between Ben and Tim Cook:

puts "Activities between #{ben["first_name]
 and #
# - quick checkin over facetime
# - met at Cupertino

# CHALLENGE:

# across all contacts (sample output below):

# ---------------------------------
# Ben's Activities:
# Tim Cook - quick checkin over facetime
# Tim Cook - met at Cupertino
# Jeff Bezos - met at Blue Origin HQ
